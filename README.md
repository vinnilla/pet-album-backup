#Pet Album
This Ruby on Rails app is designed to be a combination of Pinterest and Instagram for pets. The main functionality of this web application is the ability to create pet profiles and add albums and photos to that profile. Other users can view your pet profiles and decide whether or not they should follow you.

Since Heroku's database is not persistent, images uploaded to my app on Heroku may randomly disappear.
